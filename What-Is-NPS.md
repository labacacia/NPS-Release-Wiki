## The Problem: HTTP Was Built for Humans

Every HTTP/REST/GraphQL API on the planet was designed around the assumption that a human browser reads the response. When an AI agent replaces that browser, three structural inefficiencies kick in immediately.

**Schema repetition.** A REST endpoint re-transmits its field names, type hints, and nesting structure on every single response. An agent querying a product catalog a hundred times receives the same structural skeleton a hundred times. There is no protocol-level mechanism to say "you already know this shape — here is only the data."

**No agent identity.** HTTP authentication is a patchwork of cookies, API keys, OAuth, and mTLS, none of which have any concept of "this is an AI agent acting on behalf of a user, with these declared capabilities and this bounded scope." When Agent A delegates a sub-task to Agent B, HTTP offers no standard answer to the question: *does A actually speak for the user?*

**Single-request, no orchestration.** REST is request-response. Streaming was bolted on in 2009 via SSE and chunked transfer. Multi-agent coordination is left entirely to application frameworks like LangGraph, Temporal, or Airflow — not the wire protocol.

## The Solution: Five Coordinated Protocols

**NPS (Neural Protocol Suite)** is a purpose-built protocol family that replaces the HTTP/REST stack for AI-native workloads. Rather than patching HTTP, it starts from scratch with a single design question: *what would a network protocol look like if AI agents were the primary client?*

The suite has five layers, each with a well-defined analogue in the human internet stack:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│       Binary frames · MsgPack/JSON codec · AnchorFrame cache     │
│       Analogue: HTTP/2 frames / wire format                      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Transport                                                        │
│  HTTP mode:   HTTP/1.1 · HTTP/2 · HTTPS  (firewall-friendly)    │
│  Native mode: TCP · QUIC · WebSocket     (low-latency, Phase 2+) │
│               Unified default port  :17433                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every protocol shares a single default port (17433) and routes on a 1-byte frame type. A single TCP connection can carry frames from all five layers simultaneously. The minimum viable deployment is just NCP + NWP; NIP, NDP, and NOP are each individually opt-in.

The headline efficiency feature is **AnchorFrame schema deduplication**: a node publishes its data schema once, content-addressed by a SHA-256 `anchor_id`. All subsequent requests and responses carry only that identifier. Measured savings within a single agent session are 30–60% of token consumption.

---

## Who Should Use NPS?

NPS is the right choice if you are building or operating any of the following:

- **A data API consumed by AI agents** — publish an AnchorFrame once and eliminate repeated schema transmission across thousands of agent queries.
- **A multi-agent orchestration platform** — use NOP `TaskFrame` DAGs with cryptographically signed delegation chains instead of building orchestration in application code.
- **An agent marketplace or registry** — NID identity + NDP discovery give agents a globally unique, cryptographically verifiable address without running your own DNS infrastructure.
- **A compliance-bound service** — the AaaS Profile defines L1 / L2 / L3 compliance tiers with concrete conformance tests.
- **A legacy REST/gRPC/MCP service** that needs to become accessible to AI agents — deploy a Bridge Node adapter in front of it.

NPS is **not** a replacement for LLM APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) and is **not** a framework like LangChain or AutoGen. It is the **wire protocol** those frameworks speak when their agents communicate with data sources, services, and each other.

## Node Types

### Anchor Node

An **Anchor Node** is the stateless cluster entry point for an NPS deployment. It accepts inbound NWP `QueryFrame` and `ActionFrame` requests addressed to the cluster as a whole, authenticates the caller's NID, and dispatches the work into the cluster's NOP orchestration layer. Anchor Nodes optionally maintain a registry of cluster member nodes and, at AaaS Profile L2 and above, must expose that registry via the `topology.snapshot` and `topology.stream` query types. A single physical process can combine the Anchor Node role with Memory Node or other roles.

> Anchor Node was introduced in v1.0-alpha.3 by [NPS-CR-0001](https://github.com/labacacia/NPS-Release/blob/main/spec/cr/NPS-CR-0001-anchor-bridge-split.md), replacing the former `Gateway Node` type.

### Bridge Node

A **Bridge Node** translates between NPS frames and non-NPS external protocols — HTTP/REST, gRPC, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and A2A. An agent sends a standard NWP frame to the Bridge Node with a `bridge_target` parameter; the Bridge Node issues the appropriate outbound request in the target protocol's format and maps the response back into NWP frames. Bridge Nodes are stateless per request and do not participate in cluster topology. The `bridge_protocols` field in the NDP `AnnounceFrame` advertises which external protocols a given Bridge Node supports.

> Note: this is the *outbound* direction (NPS → external). The reverse direction (external → NPS) is handled by ingress adapters in the `compat/` directory (`mcp-ingress`, `a2a-ingress`, `grpc-ingress`).

### Agent Node

An **Agent Node** is an NWP-speaking AI executor — typically an LLM-driven process that both consumes and produces NPS frames. Agent Nodes carry a NIP-issued NID certificate, declare their capabilities in an `IdentFrame` handshake, and participate in NOP DAG executions as Worker Agents. The NID format is `urn:nps:agent:{issuer-domain}:{identifier}`.

### Memory Node

A **Memory Node** owns a data anchor and serves agent queries against it. It is the most common NWP node type — a product catalog, a knowledge base, a vector store, or any structured dataset. It publishes an `AnchorFrame` that agents cache, then returns schema-deduped `CapsFrame` responses to `QueryFrame` requests. An agent that has cached the anchor receives only raw field values, with no repeated structural overhead.

## Compared to MCP, A2A, and gRPC

| Dimension | MCP | A2A | gRPC | NPS |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| **Primary concern** | Tool invocation by a single LLM | Agent-to-agent collaboration | Strongly-typed RPC | Network protocol for AI agents accessing the internet |
| **Schema transmission** | Per-call or per-session (no content-addressed cache) | Per-call | Proto compiled in; no runtime dedup | One-time `AnchorFrame`; 30–60% token savings per session |
| **Agent identity** | Not defined at wire level | Defined via DID | mTLS / token | First-class `IdentFrame` + NIP CA + Ed25519 NID |
| **Orchestration** | Out-of-band (application layer) | Limited peer messaging | Out-of-band | Wire-level `TaskFrame` DAGs with delegation + sync barriers |
| **Discovery** | Not defined | Not defined | Not defined | NDP — DNS-analogous resolution with signed records |
| **NPS compatibility** | `compat/mcp-ingress` adapter | `compat/a2a-ingress` adapter | `compat/grpc-ingress` adapter | Native |

NPS does not replace MCP — it adds a network layer *beneath* it. MCP answers "how does an LLM invoke a tool"; NPS answers "how does an AI agent access the internet and talk to other agents."
